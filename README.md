# MyToken
This is a simple ERC-20 token contract implemented in Solidity. The contract allows for the creation and destruction of tokens, as well as storing information about the token.

# Requirements
The contract has public variables that store the details about the coin:

  tokenName: A string representing the name of the token.
  abbrv: A string representing the abbreviation of the token.
  totalSupply: An unsigned integer representing the total supply of the token.
  
The contract has a mapping of addresses to balances:
  balances: A mapping that associates addresses with their corresponding token balances.
  
The contract has a mint function that increases the total supply and the balance of the "sender" address by a given value:

  Parameters:
    _address: The address to which the tokens will be minted.
    _value: The amount of tokens to be minted.
  Actions:
    Increase the totalSupply by _value.
    Increase the balance of the _address by _value.

The contract has a burn function that decreases the total supply and the balance of the "sender" address by a given value:

  Parameters:
    _address: The address from which the tokens will be burned.
    _value: The amount of tokens to be burned.
  Actions:
    Check if the balance of the _address is greater than or equal to _value.
    If true, decrease the totalSupply by _value.
    Decrease the balance of the _address by _value.

# Usage
Deploy the MyToken contract to a supported Ethereum network.

Once deployed, you can interact with the contract by calling the following functions:

  mint: Creates new tokens and assigns them to a specified address.

  Parameters:
  _address: The address to which the tokens will be minted.
  _value: The amount of tokens to be minted.
  burn: Destroys existing tokens by reducing the total supply and the balance of a specified address.
  
  Parameters:
  _address: The address from which the tokens will be burned.
  _value: The amount of tokens to be burned.
